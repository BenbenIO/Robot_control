Bio-inspired robot control based on BeagleBone board
2015

This project was part of a 1-month internship. I was in charge of the programming and the electronic of the robot.
The robot is a bio-inspired robot; which purpose is to scrawl into canalization like a warm. I didnâ€™t take part into the design of the robot.

Hardware:
o BeagleBone Black
o Maxon motor control (36/3 EC)
o Maxon EC-max 283828

Software dev:
o Code::Blocks
o Putty

I used an already existing project based on the BeagleBone board to interface the motor. During this project, it was the first time I code on a Linux based board, and deal with real robotic project. 
I achieved the electronic connection and configuration with the motor. 
I was able to interface the EQEP (Enhanced Quadrature Encoder Pulse) by pulling signal out and so improve the control of the robot.
And I developed a good basic for the future robot development. 

It was really interesting and educational project.
The robot successfully accomplished a demonstration into a robotic convention, 1 month after the end of my internship.
